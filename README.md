🩺 HoloCare

AI-Powered Holographic Medical Assistant

📌 Overview

HoloCare is an AI-driven medical assistant designed to enhance healthcare visualization, diagnostics, and patient experience. The system combines deep learning, 3D visualization, and conversational AI to present patient data in an intuitive, interactive holographic format.

This project was developed as a senior capstone project and was presented at academic and engineering expos, earning multiple awards.

🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals often work with complex, fragmented patient data that can be difficult to interpret quickly. At the same time, patients may experience anxiety during waiting periods or clinical interactions.

HoloCare addresses both challenges by:

Improving data clarity and diagnostic insight

Enhancing patient comfort and engagement

🧠 Solution

HoloCare provides:

Real-time 3D visualization of patient medical data

An AI conversational assistant for patient interaction and reassurance

Intelligent data interpretation to support medical decision-making

The system is designed to support—not replace—healthcare professionals.
